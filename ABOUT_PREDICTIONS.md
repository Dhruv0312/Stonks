# About Predictions

The prediction feature in this application leverages historical stock data and advanced machine learning models to forecast potential price movements. Here's how it works:

## Data Collection
- Real-time and historical stock data is fetched from the Finnhub API.
- Key metrics such as open, close, high, low prices, and trading volume are used as inputs.

## Feature Engineering
- The data is processed to extract meaningful patterns and trends.
- Indicators like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and Bollinger Bands are calculated to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Machine Learning Models
- Models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are used to analyze time-series data.
- Predictions are generated for short-term (1-day) and medium-term (7-day) price movements.

## Confidence Scores
- Each prediction is accompanied by a confidence score, indicating the model's certainty about the forecast.
- Higher confidence scores suggest more reliable predictions.

## Limitations
- Predictions are based on historical data and may not account for sudden market events or news.
- Always use predictions as a supplementary tool and not as financial advice.

This feature is designed to provide insights into potential market trends, helping users make informed decisions.
